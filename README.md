# securechat
Secure Ephemeral Chat is a lightweight, highly secure end-to-end encrypted chat system written in Go. It is designed for ephemeral communication: no messages are ever stored on disk, and all session data vanishes the moment the program is closed. This makes it ideal for sensitive or classified communications.
